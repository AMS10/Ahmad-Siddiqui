Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AMS10/Ahmad-Siddiqui/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
